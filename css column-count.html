2.43pm: This Test is moving quickly! England were in strife at 118 for 6 but their hopes were revived by a century stand between Jamie Smith and Gus Atkinson. Smith eventually fell for 91, having smashed 41 from 24 balls to briefly leave Pakistan in disarray. England seem to be of a mind that 250 is a decent score, but we'll have to hold judgement on that for now. Still two wickets required before Pakistan go in to bat. Vish will be back shortly

    Zahid to Smith, OUT
    slog-swept but goes straight up - gottim! Smith won't be getting a century but it's been a fine knock, nevertheless. Cleverly done by Zahid and his captain, deterring Smith from hitting straight and then tossing the ball up wide of off. Smith tried to drag across the line but only got a big top edge, which Rizwan settled underneath. Pakistan fans can breathe again after a brutal counter
